Y-Combinator
============

Mysterious concept that is existed in functional programming world for decades is quite interesting and very exciting once you get to its core.

For now it is only the 

 - **Applicative Order Y Combinator** or 
 - **Z Combinator** or 
 - **Fixpoint Combinator** 

and written only in **JavaScript**. 

Things I'd like to add is: 

 - **Normal Order Y Combinator** (not that complex though)
 - C++ implementation using lambdas
